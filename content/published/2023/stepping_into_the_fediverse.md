## What is the Fediverse?
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse) explains that the term is a shorthand of "federated" and "universe", and refers to the realm of social platforms based on the [ActivityPub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub) protocol. Platforms in the Fediverse tend to be decentralized with multiple instances able to connect together via federation to allow users on each instance to interact with content across multiple of the instances.

There are a variety of platforms in the Fediverse including open-source and other alternatives to popular sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, YouTube, etc.

A quick overview of the analogous platforms:

| **Typical Social Platform** | **Example of Fediverse Platform** |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Facebook                | [Friendica](https://friendi.ca/)                     |
| Twitter                 | [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/about)                      |
| Reddit                  | [Lemmy](https://join-lemmy.org/) or [/kbin](https://kbin.pub/en)                 |
| Instagram               | [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org/)                      |
| YouTube                 | [PeerTube](https://joinpeertube.org/en_US)                      |

## How does it work?
Instances of Fediverse platforms can, but are not required to, interact with each other. This allows instances to set their own rules and policies for people whose accounts live in that instance, but if federated with another instance, those users can still interact with the remote instance's content. A benefit of this is that people can choose to create their accounts in instances which best match their requirements and whatnot, and communities of like-minded people can choose to disengage from other instances if those instances are poorly moderated, maintained, etc.
