# Introduction
PowerShell is a powerful scripting language that can automate a wide variety of tasks. common activity that IT professionals need to perform is working with data files such as CSV and XLSX files, both of which are typically associated with Microsoft Excel or other workbook/worksheet applications. Excel files are widely used for storing and analyzing data, while CSV files are simple text files that contain comma-separated values. 

In this blog post, we will take a look at how to use PowerShell to read, write, and manipulate Excel and CSV files. You will learn how to use built-in cmdlets, such as Import-Csv and Export-Csv, as well as a third-party module, **ImportExcel**, to work with these data formats. By the end of this blog post, you will be able to easily use PowerShell to handle CSV and XLSX files!

# Working with Comma-separated Values Files
PowerShell natively supports interacting with CSV files, which can enable you to get datasets into your scripts, and also provides an easy way to create objects to interact with in your scripts.

## Importing CSV Files
To import a CSV file into your terminal, use can use:

```PowerShell
Import-CSV -Path 'C:\Path\To\Your\File.csv'
```

This command will read the content of the file into the terminal and create a table-like object from the data contained in the CSV file. Often times you'll want to set the above command to a variable like so:

```PowerShell
$var = Import-CSV -Path 'C:\Path\To\Your\File.csv'
```

Once this has been completed, you can run `$var` and you should see the object printed to the terminal:

```output
griff@vm923762 ~  $var = import-csv -path 'C:\temp\excel.csv'
griff@vm923762 ~  $var

index color
----- -----
1     red
2     blue
3     yellow
4     green
5     orange
```

You can then reference properties of the object using all your usual methods of interacting with objects.

```output
griff@vm923762 ~ $var.index
1
2
3
4
5

griff@vm923762 ~ $var.color
red
blue
yellow
green
orange

griff@vm923762 ~ $var | Where-Object { $_.index -eq 1 }

index color
----- -----
1     red
```

The above shows a foundation of how this can be useful in your automations, as you can load a dataset into PowerShell and then interact with the object as you would any other object.

## Modifying CSV Files
We can modify the data in the object which resulted from our import of the CSV file as well. This is done by iterating through the properties of the object and then altering data based on conditions we define. Here's an example:

```PowerShell
$var | foreach {
  if ($_.index -eq 1) {
    $_.color = "Changed"
  }
}
```

And here is the new output of `$var`:

```output
griff@vm923762 ~ $var

index color
----- -----
1     Changed
2     blue
3     yellow
4     green
5     orange
```

You'll see in the above output that the the color for row 1 has been changed from `red` to `Changed`.
There are a variety of ways to accomplish this; I just picked one example. Once you've made your edits, all you need to do is then pipe your `$var` into the command to export as a CSV, which we'll talk about below.

## Exporting CSV Files
In addition to importing and modifying data from CSV files, we can export that data (or other data) out to a CSV file as well. This is accomplished by piping our `$var` object to the `Export-CSV` command:

```Powershell
$var | Export-CSV -Path 'C:\Path\To\Your\Destination.csv' -NoTypeInformation
```

Opening the resulting CSV file (or importing it into PowerShell like we learned earlier), will result in the updated data as shown here:

|index|color|
|---|---|
|1|Changed|
|2|blue|
|3|yellow|
|4|green|
|5|orange|

I want to specifically point out the `-NoTypeInformation` parameter that we specified in the above command. If you're using Windows PowerShell (which is by default version 5.1 as bundled with Windows), then you'll want to specify this parameter which suppresses outputting the TYPE information header into your CSV file. By doing this, the first row of cells in your CSV file will actually be the table headers. If you do not specify this, then you get a row above your table headers that looks like this:

```output
#TYPE Selected.System.Management.ManagementObject
```

If I had to guess, I'd say most people most of the time probably don't want this. Luckily, beginning in PowerShell 6, this has become the default so if you're using PowerShell 6 or PowerShell 7 you can skip adding this parameter, though it won't hurt if you continue to include it.

# Working with Excel Files
Now we know how to use the inbuilt commands in PowerShell to work with CSV files, but XLSX files are just as common. Unfortunately there is no native handling of this file format in PowerShell, however there is a third-party module that was developed that does a great job of allowing us to accomplish this; the module is the **ImportExcel** module.

You can install this module and then import it using the following command:

```PowerShell
Install-Module -Name 'ImportExcel' -Force
Import-Module -Name 'ImportExcel' -Force
```

## Importing Excel Files
Importing an XLSX file is quite similar in terms of the command and syntax, just using a different module:

```PowerShell
Import-Excel -Path 'C:\Path\To\Your\File.xlsx'
```

Again, you'll often want to assign this to a variable so you can easily recall it and interact with it. I'll use `$var` again:

```PowerShell
$var = Import-Excel -Path 'C:\Path\To\Your\File.xlsx'
```

In another similarity, here is what the output of `$var` looks like in this scenario:

```output
griff@vm923762 ~  $var = Import-Excel -Path 'C:\temp\excel.xlsx'
griff@vm923762 ~  $var

index color
----- -----
 1.00 red
 2.00 blue
 3.00 yellow
 4.00 green
 5.00 orange
```

Notice that in this instance, importing an Excel workbook instead of a comma-separated values file, that the values of each `index` are doubles instead of integers. While this is the case, if you select only that property of the object using `$var.index`, you'll see that the `.00` does not print to the terminal any longer --  beware it is still a double even though it doesn't look like it. You can validate this by testing `$var.index[0] -is [double]` if you want. This won't prove to be an issue for many people, but for those instances where it is, you could convert the value for each iteration of `index` inside the object to a string, which then allows you to manipulate those values with convenient operators such as `.split` and `.substring`. But I digress.

For the most part, it works pretty much the same as with importing CSVs. There is some additional functionality, such as the ability to import specific worksheets from the workbook using the `-Worksheet` parameter, or filter which columns/rows you'd like to import using `-StartRow`, `-EndRow`, `-StartColumn`, and `-EndColumn` as well as other options.

## Modifying Excel Files
We can use the same method we used earlier to modify the object we imported from the Excel file.
For this example, let's increment the index of each row by 1:

```PowerShell
$var | foreach {
  if ($_.index) {
    $_.index = $_.index + 1.00
  }
}
```

The successful output of our modified `$var` is now:

```output
griff@vm923762 ~ $var

index color
----- -----
 2.00 red
 3.00 blue
 4.00 yellow
 5.00 green
 6.00 orange
```

Just like with our CSV example earlier, now to export it to Excel, you'll pipe your `$var` to the command to export as an Excel file, which we'll look at below.

## Exporting Excel Files
To export your object to an XLSX file, pipe the `$var` to `Export-Excel`:

```PowerShell
$var | Export-Excel -Path 'C:\temp\output2.xlsx'
```

There are *a lot* of optional parameters for this command, and I highly recommend checking out the module's documentation, which can be found the in Additional Resources section at the end of this post. You can create pivot tables, name worksheets, use multiple worksheets, and all kinds of nifty things!

Opening our exported XLSX file (or importing it into the terminal as we learned earlier), shows the following:

| index | color  |
| ----- | ------ |
| 2     | red    |
| 3     | blue   |
| 4     | yellow |
| 5     | green  |
| 6     | orange |
