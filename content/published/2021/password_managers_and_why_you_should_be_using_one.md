 Let me ask you some questions:

- Do you have that one account that you only have to log into once in a blue moon, and you pretty much always have to reset the password?
- Do any of your accounts use the same password?
- Do you have any of your passwords written down somewhere or typed out in a Word document or Excel spreadsheet or some other similar list?

If you answered "yes" to one or more of these questions, then using a password manager may benefit you.

# What is a password manager?

A password manager is an program that digitally and securely stores your login information for various accounts. Using just a single "master password," you can access the login information for any and all of your stored accounts witout having to know every account's information.

# Why use a password manager?

## Security

The most important benefit of a password manager is security. If you have your passwords written down somewhere, then it is more likely someone may accidentally (or intentionally) find out how to access your accounts; additionally, if they're written down, they can be lost or destroyed. If you have more than one account using the same password, if that password is discovered or stolen, the theif could gain access to many of your accounts. Using a password manager allows you to securely store your passwords, have convenient access to them, and also lets you generate more complex and secure passwords without the need to memorize them.

## Simplicity

Security is important. But the extra-nice thing about a password maanger is the simplicity. Instead of having to remember of the logon information for many accounts, you can simply remember a single "master password." Some password managers even support web browser add-ons/extensions that will auto-fill your login information into a webpage after you enter your master password.

Other neat stuff Bitwarden supports includes: locally hosting it on your own server instead of cloud hosted, it supports multi-factor authentication and is compatible with the Yubico YubiKey (a review on that to come), a password generator, configuration for auto-fill on websites, and the ability to store more than passwords securely--including secure notes, credit card information, and identity information. And so much more.

# Bringing it all together

Regardless of which solution you choose, a password manager is crucial to increasing your online security--unless you can just memorize every single password you have. Combining a password manager with some form of multi-factor authentication provides a high degree of security while also making life more convenient by requiring you to only remembe a single master password. If you haven't tried a password manager, don't delay! Try one today.
