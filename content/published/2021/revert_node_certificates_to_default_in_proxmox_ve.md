# Purpose
The purpose of this document is to explain the steps necessary to reset and regenerate the state of the node/host certificates.

# Assumptions
This document assumes you have a properly functioning Proxmox cluster with all nodes accessible on the network/via web browser. You’re replaced or modified any of the certificate or key files generated by PVE and now need to revert to the default state.

# Solution
## Step 1 - Cleanup existing certificate files

Delete or move the following files:
```
/etc/pve/pve-root-ca.pem
/etc/pve/priv/pve-root-ca.key
/etc/pve/nodes/<node>/pve-ssl.pem
/etc/pve/nodes/<node>/pve-ssl.key
```

>[!info] Note
>The latter two need to be repeated for all nodes if you have a cluster.

>[!warning] Warning
If you do not repeat the latter two on each host, your issue **will** return.

## Regenerate certificates

Afterwards, run the following command on each node of the cluster to re-generate the certificates and keys:
```bash
pvecm updatecerts -f
```
