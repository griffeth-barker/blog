# Achievement Get! 
Welcome to another intermittently updated blog. This site is a project of mine to which I hope to dedicate more attention. I take a lot of notes throughout the course of my work, and the more polished of those notes will be published here in the hopes that they might assist another systems administrator or IT professional headed down the same path.

# About the Site
This blog is hosted via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), using the [Hugo SSG](https://gohugo.io/) (static-site generator). The site content is written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)and managed in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), which is my preferred knowledge management/notetaking application.

# About the Author
