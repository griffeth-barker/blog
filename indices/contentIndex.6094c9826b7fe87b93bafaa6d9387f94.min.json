I take a lot of notes throughout the course of my work, and the more polished of those notes will be published here in the hopes that they might assist another systems administrator or IT professional headed down the same path.\n\n# 🌐 About the Site\nThis blog is hosted via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), using the [Hugo SSG](https://gohugo.io/) (static-site generator).
