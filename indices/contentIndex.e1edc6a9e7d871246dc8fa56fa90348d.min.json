Or how about when you open a program and it tells you there's an update? You just want to use your software, so if you're like me, you've probably clicked \"ignore\" or closed the update to just get to what you were doing. But there is a better way! Nobody wants to take the time to keep all of their software up-to-date. In this brief blog post, I take a look at how you can make this happen \"auto-magically,\" at least for many common programs.\n\n# Installing Chocolatey package manager\n\n![](https://audiomgtmoregame.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/chocolatey-logo.png?w=1024)\n\nThe first thing we will need to do is install the Chocolatey package manager. This is going to let us have access to one central source for the programs and their updates.\n\nTo install Chocolatey, open Windows PowerShell by going to the Start Menu and typing `powershell` . Right-click the top result, and click \"Run as Administrator.\" This will require you to have administrative rights. If you do not have administrative rights, this process will not be possible.\n\nIn the Windows PowerShell window that appears, paste the following command:\n```PowerShell\nSet-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))\n```\n\nOnce that command has completed, close Windows PowerShell and launch it again with administrative rights like we just did.\n\n# Installing packages\n\nNow we need to install the packages that we want to keep up-to-date. To find out if a program you have has a package available, use the below example in PowerShell:\n\nchoco search _programname_\n\nwhere¬†_programname_¬†is the name of the program you want. Some examples might be:\n\n- adobereader\n- adobe-connect\n- googlechrome\n- microsoft-edge\n- discord\n- putty\n- icue\n- bitwarden\n- lastpass\n- obs-studio\n- conemu\n- forticlientvpn\n- openvpn\n- java\n- jre\n- logitech-options\n- reflect-free\n- and many, many more.\n\nTo actually install any or a combination of these, use the following command:\n```PowerShell\nchoco install programname -y\n```\n\nwhere¬†`programname`¬†is the package name. You can list multiple package names in succession to install multiple programs at once:\n\n```PowerShell\nchoco install programname1 programname2 programname3 -y\n```\n\nChocolatey will download the packages and install them.\n\n# Writing the update script\n\nWith the packages installed, now we need to create a super simple script that will update those packages.\n\nOpen Notepad by going to the Start Menu and typing \"notepad\" (quotations omitted) and running the top result.\n\nIn the blank document that opens, type the following:\n```PowerShell\nchoco upgrade all -Y\n```\n\nIf you continually run into errors with certain packages updating and don't mind the insecurity of it, you can also use:\n\nchoco upgrade all -Y --ignore-checksums\n\n\u003e[!warning] Warning\n\u003eThis is not necessarily a security best practice. You should proceed with caution and as appropriate to your environment.\n\nNow save this by going to File \u003e Save As... In the Save As window, change the drop-down menu for the file type. It will be defaulted to .txt and we want to change it to All Files. Type a name for the file ending with .ps1. Example:\n\nchocolatey-updater.ps1\n\nSave it to a location where it won't be touched and will always be available. I have mine saved to a folder I created at C:\\ScheduledTasks but you can put yours wherever you want.\n\n## Scheduling automatic updates\n\nFinally, now that we have installed packages and created a script to update them, we will want to schedule the update process to be completely automatic. Because being hands-off is the whole point!\n\nOpen the Task Scheduler by clicking the Start Menu and typing \"task scheduler\" then running the top result.\n\nIn the resulting Task Scheduler window, open the Action menu, then click Create Task.\n\n![](https://audiomgtmoregame.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/screenshot-2020-12-15-135956.jpg?w=532)\n\nGive your scheduled task a name and a description, then select \"Run whether user is logged in or not\" and check \"Run with highest privileges.\" Finally, Configure for: Windows 10.\n\nMove to the Triggers tab.\n\n![](https://audiomgtmoregame.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-3.png?w=976)\n\nAdd a new trigger to begin the task on a schedule. Input your desired start date, reoccurence period, and ensure \"Enabled\" is checked, then click OK.\n\nMove to the Actions tab.\n\n![](https://audiomgtmoregame.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-4.png?w=972)\n\nMake the action \"Start a program\" and in the Program/script field, paste the path to PowerShell:\n\n%SystemRoot%\\system32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe\n\nIn the Add arguments field, add the following:\n\n-file scriptpath\n\nwhere scriptpath is the path to where you saved your script earlier. My example looked like this:\n\n-file C:\\ScheduledTasks\\chocolatey-updates.ps1\n\nWhen done, click OK on all remaining Task Scheduler windows and the task will be scheduled. Now, as long as your computer is on, you leave the task scheduled, and the script is available where you saved it, your computer should automatically update your specified programs without you having to do anything at all.\n\nI have been keeping my computers up to date like this for several years (set to automatically update everything weekly) and it saves me tons of time, and I rarely get notifications about new versions or annoying popups anymore.\n\n## Bringing it all together\n\nIn this process, we installed Chocolately package manager, figured out what programs we wanted to keep up to date that were available through Chocolatey, installed those programs, wrote the update script/command, and scheduled PowerShell to run that command at a regular interval.\n\nHow did this go for you? Got any other neat tips and tricks for keeping your system running in great shape? I'd love for you to share them in the comments.","lastmodified":"2023-10-21T22:26:21.646664931Z","tags":["windows","software","patching","chocolatey"]},"/published/2020/powershell_remove_net_printer_for_all_users":{"title":"Use PowerShell to remove a network printer for all users","content":"\n# Purpose\nThis brief article details the commands necessary to use PowerShell to remove a network printer for all users of a computer.\n\n# Prerequisites\nThe below actions require the executing user to be an administrator of the remote workstation, or a Domain Administrator.\n\n# Solution\n## Establish a Remote PowerShell session\nIn an elevated PowerShell session (running as administrator), run the following command;\n```PowerShell\nEnter-PsSession -ComputerName HOSTNAME.FQDN\n```\nwhere¬†`HOSTNAME.FQDN`¬†is the fully-qualified domain name of the workstation in question.\n\n_Example:_¬†`desktop01.yourdomain.com`  \n\nYou¬†_can_¬†actually perform these commands without using the FQDN, and using the short name instead.\n\n## Remove the network printer for all users\nOnce you‚Äôve entered the remote PowerShell session successfully, run the following commands in sequence;\n```PowerShell\nGet-WmiObject -Class Win32_Printer | Where-Object {$_.Name -eq ‚Äò\\\\PRINTSERVER\\Shared-printer‚Äò}\n```\nwhere¬†`PRINTSERVER`¬†is the NETBIOS name of your print server from which the printer is shared and¬†`Shared-printer`¬†is the shared name of the printer you‚Äôd like to remove.

I'm sorry to say, but I am going to spend a moment griping about it again. Over the last several months, I have been¬†constantly¬†frustrated with the pen not attaching without careful placement, the pen falling off the magnet, and my inevitable loss of the pen since it fell off the magnet somewhere. Sure, you can get a case that secures the pen--but this should not be necessary. By design, the pen should be easy to keep track of, use, and stow. This has become a major downside to the device, for me at least. But onto more positive things.*\n\u003e\n_One of my primary questions was whether I could use the tablet as a replacement for my laptop when traveling. The short answer is:¬†**absolutely**! I spent the week of my recent vacation reading books, browsing the web, writing for this blog, editing a couple of casual photos, playing games, doing email, and a couple of other tasks, including troubleshooting some stuff with my parents' home network. I had brought my laptop--just in case--and found that I didn't pull it out even once. The Tab S6 was all I needed! Now, a qualification is necessary here. I did bring my Logitech MX Master 3 bluetooth mouse and my Keychron K6 bluetooth mechanical keyboard for when I was writing my blog posts, but otherwise, the tablet by itself was just fine._\n\u003e\n_So, my verdict after such extended use and travel with the Tab S6, is that I highly recommend it, but do note that some kind of case or other solution to keep track of the pen will be absolutely necessary._\n\nReleased in August of 2019, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 becomes the new Samsung standard for tablets, in place of the Tab 4 and Tab 5Se. I¬† picked up the Tab S6 on an open-box deal from Best Buy (not sponsored). I have previously owned an iPad Mini years back, as well as the Microsoft Surface Pro 3, though I no longer have either. The itch for a tablet was strong, and this time around, Samsung won the vote. But why? Let's take a look at some of the selling points.\n\n# Price\n\nThe Tab S6, without the open-box deal I got, currently retails for roughly $650.00 USD for the base model at the time of writing. However, if you keep an eye out, you can snag an open-box deal on one for about 200.00 USD less! And at that price point, this tablet really packs a punch. Why?\n\n# Specifications\n\nBecause 650.00 USD (or 450.00 USD in my case) gets you a 10.5 inch screen, 128 GB of solid state storage, 6 GB of RAM, and a snappy octa-core processor. The base price even includes the tablet's pen like with the Microsoft Surface, which other tablet manufacturers either don't have (looking at you, Kindle) or require you to purchase separately (Apple).\n\n# UX\n\nObviously the user experience is a big deal, since I'm going to be the¬†_user experiencing_¬†the tablet. I was looking for a true tablet experience for while I am away from my custom desktop computer. I'm big on customization and versatility. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ running Android and enjoy it very much. The Google Play store has a huge variety of apps available, including the Microsoft Office suite, Wordpress, as well as apps for social media, photography, games and other entertainment, as well as utilities that can be useful for an on-the-go IT professional such as myself. Additionally, while I like the Samsung flavor of the graphical user interface, Android allows me to overlay my own preferred launchers should I so desire--and without having to root or jailbreak my device to do so. I am currently using the Microsoft Launcher.\n\nSo thus far I've mentioned a few things that I really like about the device. But what cons are worth mentioning?\n\n# Downfalls\n\nLet's start with the pen. It is made of a plastic, which feels a bit light and cheap--though I suppose I didn't expect too much for an included accessory. It pales in comparison to the pen that comes with the Microsoft Surface, and is also not as good as the Apple Pencil.\n\nDespite being too light for my taste, and a bit cheap-feeling, my biggest gripe comes to storage of the pen. There is a shallow groove on the rear of the device beneath the camera lens. This groove has two magnetic points that hold the pen in place--uh, sometimes. The pen falls off the groove or gets knocked out of place easily, and the groove is difficult to find without looking at the rear of the device. I've lost my pen quite a few times in the last two weeks. To further my compaint, snapping the pen to the rear of the device means that the device can no longer rest flat on a surface such as a table, desk, and also restricts the use of some wall mounts. It also happens to be right where I prefer to hold the device while on the go, which is a bit inconvenient. None of these things will necessarily be a downfall for you, but they were for me. After extensive use, I've found that it is actually quite difficult to attached the pen to it's groove without looking directly at it, and that the pen falls off quite easily, which has become annoying.\n\nFurther, the pen has less functionality than I would like. The S Gestures that you can do to interact with the OS are convenient and nice. Unfortunately, that is where the interaction runs out. The pen can be used as a replacement for your finger in other apps, but the button will continue to function in relation to the OS, not the app, thus prohibiting a large amount of usefulness. One thing I want to be able to do is hold the pen, lean back, and flick it up and down to scroll up and down a webpage or other app, but alas, this functionality seems to be missing.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nReally, the pen was the only complaint I had with the purchase--and though I have things I wish Samsung had done better, the pen is still functional and is not uncomfortable to hold for short amounts of time. The pen might be a dealbreaker for you, or you might never touch it? So what am I doing with the device?\n\nIn the weeks that I've had the Galaxy Tab 6S, I have used it to import photos from my Canon DSLR (no additional software required), edit RAW image files in Google's Snapseed photo editing application--which is shockingly good for being free, browse Reddit, the internet, access banking information, VPN into my home network, VPN into my work network, remote access and administer both workstations and servers, and listened to plenty of music and watched videos on YouTube.\n\nI have had zero issues accomplishing what I need to. In fact, just earlier this evening my wife and I were at dinner and I had the tablet with me. I got a call from work with an emergency. I wouldn't have lugged a laptop with me, but I happened to habe the tablet. Within a minute or so, I was VPN'ed into our company's network, accessed a server, and did what I needed to do to assist an employee.\n\nSimilarly, the other night I had the opportunity to pick up my camera and create some images of my wife. I didn't want to wait to import the photos on my desktop and process them there, so I plugged my camera into my tablet, imported the photos, and processed them, in Snapseed. Within 10 minutes I had a couple of fantastic images to share.\n\nI've found that overall the tablet has conformed to my needs and flexed to every situation I've found myself in thus far. It has been a good buy. Would I buy it again? Most likely! Given that I like to use the pen and the pen is quite subpar, I likely would not pay full price for one, but I would willingly pay open-box or used pricing again. If you're looking for a powerful daily driver of a tablet, then this might just be the ticket for you!","lastmodified":"2023-10-21T22:26:21.646664931Z","tags":["hardware","review"]},"/published/2021/fix_mapped_drives_not_showing_in_dialogues":{"title":"Fix mapped drives not showing in Open and Save dialogues in Windows","content":"\n# Problem\nUser‚Äôs mapped drives do not show up as mapped in application Open/Save prompts, even though they show correctly in¬†**File Explorer \u003e This PC**.\n\n# Environment\nThis issue affects Windows 10 workstations joined to a domain where the user has one or more drives that are automatically mapped via Group Policy Object or NETLOGON script.\n\n# Cause\nThis problem occurs because UAC treats members of the Administrators group as standard users.

Using just a single \"master password,\" you can access the login information for any and all of your stored accounts witout having to know every account's information.\n\n# Why use a password manager?\n\n## Security\n\nThe most important benefit of a password manager is security. If you have your passwords written down somewhere, then it is more likely someone may accidentally (or intentionally) find out how to access your accounts; additionally, if they're written down, they can be lost or destroyed. If you have more than one account using the same password, if that password is discovered or stolen, the theif could gain access to many of your accounts. Using a password manager allows you to securely store your passwords, have convenient access to them, and also lets you generate more complex and secure passwords without the need to memorize them.\n\n## Simplicity\n\nSecurity is important. But the extra-nice thing about a password maanger is the simplicity. Instead of having to remember of the logon information for many accounts, you can simply remember a single \"master password.\" Some password managers even support web browser add-ons/extensions that will auto-fill your login information into a webpage after you enter your master password.\n\n# My recommended solution\n\n![](https://audiomgtmoregame.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/bitwarden_logo_horizontal.png?w=1024)\n\n**Bitwarden**¬†is a fantastic and free option for a password manager.

If you haven't tried a password manager, don't delay! Try one today.\n\nHave you used a password manager before? If so, what was it and what were your thoughts? Have you had other issues or complaints about memorizing passwords?

There's so much information that we deal with on a daily basis. Not only is there an interminable amount of information, but then there's the stuff you have to¬†_do_¬†with that information ‚Äî which usually ends up generating more information, or more stuff for you to do with the new information. That explanation might sound as muddled as the actual process of managing everything going on in life.\n\nEnter: note taking and organization applications. There are a variety of apps and tools that help with managing information like notes, schedules, files, etc. These solutions range from the simplest of apps ‚Äî such as the Notes app included in iOS or the To-do app in Windows 10 ‚Äî to more robust solutions such as Microsoft's OneNote, as well as more speciality and niche solutions such as Milanote. There are tons of options, though they range in functionality and compatibility with various platforms.\n\nFor example, many people love Bear and it's Markdown-based formatting, but it is only available on iOS and macOS. Others prefer OneNote for it's wide compatibility across many platforms (even Linux distributions, if you're willing to put in a bit of work), but then struggle with many of the glitches and downfalls of Microsoft's less-than-consistent user experience and functionality.\n\nWith just as many options as the information you have to manage, there has to be one that sticks out among the others. I have a notion that there are a few. One of them is...well...Notion!\n\n# What is Notion?\n\nNotion advertises itself as the \"all-in-one\" workspace for your whole team. It provides writing, planning, and organizational utility in a way that can easily be harnessed by either individuals or entire teams and companies. The features are so robust that many organizations ranging from enterprises such as Pixar, IBM, Nike, and Slack to prominent creators and platform providers in various industries such as Spotify, Square, and even content creators such as Linus Media Group. But it's also used by many students, teachers, writers, podcasters, and many other individuals.\n\n# What can Notion do?\n\nNotion is one of those solutions where you get a lot of flexibility to make it do most whatever you'd like it to. But out of the box, there is a wide range of things that it can do to help you keep track of all your notions.\n\n- Organize just about any information you can think of\n- Central, powerful search of all your stuff\n- Realtime collaboration with other users\n- Scalable - start as small as you and grow your workspace with your needs\n- Embedded apps such as Google Docs, Figma, Twitter, Github, CodePen, Spotify, and more\n- Project and task management\n- Multi-database view\n- Focus-based notetaking\n- Drag and drop organization ‚Äî or metadata organization\n- Rich and varied content support\n- Content creation and tracking\n- New API functionality to tie in other applications and automate functions\n- And so much more...\n\n# Why should I use Notion?\n\nThe reason to use Notion can vary from person to person, however most people use it because it is an effective and easy solution to organize all kinds of information, and it's free. One of my favorite reasons to use it is that it is one of the few solutions that I have used where it really feels like it was designed by actual people, for actual people to use.\n\nBy and large, it is simple to pick up and start using right away without diving too deep in guides and having to learn. If you want to dive into more advanced stuff, you absolutely can and there is a great website, many community members' blogs, and a Discord server full of helpful people that make advanced tinkering and organization easy.\n\nWhatever your reason is, there's nothing to lose by giving Notion a shot and making a go at organizing anything and everything you could want.

Print servers are prime candidates to be hosted on the CLI-based Windows Server Core variant of Windows Server, especially where they are so easily managed through remote PowerShell. In this brief article, we'll take a quick look at spinning up a core print server and some of the options available for administering the new server.\n\n# Spinning up your machine\n\nWhether you are using traditional hardware for your server (a rackmount server, blade server, tower server/desktop PC) or a virtualized environment, you'll first need to actually install Windows Server Core on your machine. For my environment, I spun up a virtual machine in my Proxmox virtual environment, but many may be using VMware, Hyper-V, or other solutions which will work perfectly fine.\n\n# Adding the features and roles to the server\n\nOnce you have Windows installed and your requisite network and domain configuration done, add the necessary services and features to the server:\n\n```PowerShell\nInstall-WindowsFeature Print-Services\n```\n\nThis will install the Print Services role as well as the Print Server Role Service. No further configuration is necessary as far as the services and features go. All that is left to do is add some printers!\n\n# Administering the server\n\nThere are multiple ways to administer your new Windows Core print server.\n\n### PowerShell\n\nArguably the correct way to manage a Windows Core server, is PowerShell. Like other deployments, a print server is managable through the command line with general ease. Beginning with Server 2012's Core version, there are many print management commands available to administrators.\n\nAs an example, we can configure a printer using just two commands:\n\nAdding the printer port:\n\n```PowerShell\nAdd-PrinterPort -Name \"192.168.254.5\" -PrinterHostAddress \"192.168.254.5\"\n```\n\nAdding, sharing, and publishing the printer:\n```PowerShell\nAdd-Printer -Name YourPrinter01 -DriverName \"HP Universal Print Driver PCL6\" -PortName 192.168.254.5 -Shared -ShareName \"YourPrinter01\" -Published\n```\n\n### VBS\n\nAn archaic option also exists. At¬†`C:\\Windows\\System32\\Printing_Admin_Scripts`¬†you'll find a variety of VBS scripts that can be used to administer the print server. But seriously, who is preferring VBS when we have PowerShell?\n\nAs an example, we can configure a printer using the following commands:\n\n\n```PowerShell\n# Creating the printer port:\ncscript prnport.vbs -a -r 192.168.254.5 -h 192.168.254.5 -o raw\n\n# Adding printer on a specific printer port:\ncscript prnmngr.vbs -a -p YourPrinter01 -m \"HP Universal Print Driver PCL6\" -r 192.168.254.5\n\n# Sharing the printer:\ncscript prncnfg.vbs -t -p YourPrinter01 -r 192.168.254.5 -h YourPrinter01 +shared -direct -m \"Default printer for HR\" -l \"YourDesiredLocation\"\n\n# Publishing the printer to Active Directory:\ncscript pubprn.vbs \\\\printserver\\YourPrinter01 \"LDAP://CN=YourContainer,DC=YourDomain,DC=com\"\n```\n\n\n### GUI\n\nIf you really just can't let go of using the graphical user interface just yet as you ease into command-line-based administration you can still get your hands on the GUI by executing:¬†`C:\\Windows\\System32\\printui.exe /il`\n\nAdditionally, on a remote machine, you can connect RSAT to your Windows Core print server and use the Print Management snap-in for the Microsoft Management Console to visually administer the print server.\n\nBut seriously...get comfortable with PowerShell. This is the way.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nAnd, well, that's pretty much it. There is certainly a more granular level of detail we could go into, but for the purposes of a general overview, I think that does it. Windows Core servers are quick and easy to spin up and an absolute breeze to configure if you are comfortable with PowerShell. In a lab environment, they can also be a great way to get more comfortable with PowerShell if you are just learning. Go ahead and spin up a Windows Core server in VirtualBox or your choice of virtualization bench and give it a try!\n\nWhat are you using core servers for in your environment, and how do you like it? I'd love to hear from you in the comments below.\n\n---\n\n## Additional Reading\n\n[Install Print and Document Services | Microsoft Docs](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8562458718891840214/175097051257976925#)\n\n[Using Server Core as a Print Server - Microsoft Tech Community](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8562458718891840214/175097051257976925#)","lastmodified":"2023-10-21T22:26:21.646664931Z","tags":["windows"]},"/published/2023/get_your_public_ip_address_using_terminal":{"title":"Get Your Public IP Address Using the Terminal","content":"\nWe get our private IP address using the terminal all the time. I'm sure we've all used `ipconfig /all` in Windows. It's simple and much faster than opening all the steps to open Network Connections, opening a NIC's properties, and opening the IPv4 configuration. The terminal tends to save you time as you get comfortable with it!\n\nWouldn't it be nice if you could do the same thing to get your current public IP though? \nGood news: we can!\n\nYou've probably used websites such as **WhatIsMyIPAddress** and **IPChicken** before; there are various sites out there that show you your public IP address. **ifconfig.me** is my site of choice, so I'll use it for this example. \n\nIf you were to navigate to https://ifconfig.me/ip in your web browser of choice, you would see nothing except a public IP address.\n\nWe can use several several commands to interact with these websites and get our current public IP address from this URL.\n\n## PowerShell\n### Invoke-WebRequest\nThe `Invoke-WebRequest` command sends requests to a URL.

I won't go into tons of detail here, but please for your benefit check out the link below and get a trial or use the free version for a bit to see how it can absolutely change your IT life.\n\n[Link](https://devolutions.net/remote-desktop-manager/)\n\n## Devolutions Server\nDVLS is essentially a password manager for your remote connections. It interfaces with Remote Desktop Manager seamlessly and features Privileged Access Management to make maintaining IT security significantly easier, and enables you to empower less technical team members to resolve issues without permanently giving them additional permissions. It also has an inbuilt gateway functionality and you can use as a bastion server, which further increases security. It's a little bit involved to learn all the permissions and setup, but well worth it in the end. And the price is quite reasonable for what it is.\n\n[Link](https://devolutions.net/server/)\n\n## VSCode\nMicrosoft's Visual Studio Code is a fantastic and free tool for editing various file types that are common among systems administrators, be it PowerShell scripts, Shell scripts, XML, XAML, YAML, JSON, and more. With a ridiculously vibrant store of extensions, you can make connections to SQL servers, run queries, make API calls, manage resources in Azure, and so much more. \n\nFor basic notepad use, I of course love Notepad++, but when it comes to scripting and anything that you'll work on for more than a couple of minutes, I highly recommend VSCode.\n\n[Link](https://code.visualstudio.com/)\n\n## ObsidianMD\nObsidian is a Markdown editor that is fantastic for notetaking and organizing your knowledge. As mentioned on the home page of this blog, there's plenty to learn and plenty to forget in IT. Obsidian is great because it can be as simple or as involved as you'd like. It is very low-friction to get started. It is free, and ultimately has no lock-in since your notes are just markdown files stored in a set of directories. I use this for daily notes, writing documentation, and even writing this blog.\n\n[Link](https://obsidian.md/)\n\n## Your choice of Large Language Model (LLM)\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) and artificial intelligence (AI) in general are becoming much more prominent and readily-accessible.  There are plenty of things they are great at accomplishing, but \nthere are two reasons I recommend using one of your choice.\n\nFirstly, they're better search engines (assuming they have access to the internet, unlike OpenAI's GPT-3). You'll likely find that you get significantly better results asking ChatGPT or Bard questions, as opposed to Googling them. That said, learning how to get what you want out of these LLMs is a science, and takes a bit of learning.\n\nSecondly, they're surprisingly decent at writing you starter code. Teams I've worked with have utilized it to write out the beginnings of switch configurations, PowerShell scripts, Ansible playbooks, etc. Of course, the LLMs will get things wrong and you certainly need to go over everything they generate, but they'll get you pretty close, very quickly.\n\nThis is going to be the way of the future, so we might as well embrace it now!\n\n[OpenAI ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) | [Google Bard](https://bard.google.com/) | And others...\n\n# Hardware\n\n## StarTech USB Crash Cart Adapter\nIn my first year as a systems administrator, I spent a lot of time propping 4:3 monitors up against server racks and balancing USB keyboards on my hand while trying to type, since we didn't really have rack-mounted KVMs anymore. That got old real quick! I went searching for a solution to this problem. Enter the StarTech USB Crash Cart Adapter.\n\nThis little package connects to your laptop via USB, and then connects to the server via VGA and USB. Using the included software, you will get the server's video output in a window on your screen, and you can use your laptop to control the server. This is a lifesaver in \"break-glass\" situations where things have gone very sideways, situations where the network is unavailable, or when you need to do initial setup on a host or array where the IPMI is not connected yet.\n\nThis thing comes in around $500 USD, but sure beats doing what I was doing previously. Obviously it's slightly less valuable to those who have rack-mounted KVMs in every rack, consistently. But if you don't, this is for you!\n\n[Link](https://www.amazon.com/StarTech-com-Console-Portable-Adapter-Transfer/dp/B00IZGR6IK/ref=sr_1_4?crid=DXUA9HM1222Y\u0026keywords=startech+crash+cart+adapter\u0026qid=1687409352\u0026s=electronics\u0026sprefix=startech+crash+cart+adapt%2Celectronics%2C147\u0026sr=1-4\u0026ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.5137e923-c7be-4142-979c-7c68b6c26f63)\n\n## iodd Mini USB 3.0 256-bit Secure encrypted SSD Drive\nAt the start of my career in IT, I distinctly remember maintaining a small zipped binder of USB drives, each 16 GB, each containing the bootable installation media for various operating systems used in my environment. It worked, but it certainly was not convenient and required a lot of upkeep as new media became available.\n\nSome years ago, I picked up iodd's mini-USB SSD drive. This little device has an m.2 SSD inside, which is user-replaceable, and can hold a large quantity of ISOs and installation media. The firmware on the board allows you to mount those ISOs and present them to a physical system as a virtual CD-ROM drive. If you've worked with Dell iDrac or similar IPMI platforms and used the virtual media mapping functions in those systems, this is similar, but occurs on a physical level.\n\nIt weighs virtually nothing, slips into your pocket, and is simple to maintain. At just over $100 USD at the time of writing, I highly recommend having one of these around for desktop hardware technicians or small shops where time savings are crucial, and staffing levels are low. I especially recommend this for shops where an imaging/deployment tool is unavilable (SCCM or other PXE boot, SmartDeploy, etc.).\n\n[Link](https://www.amazon.com/256-bit-Secure-encrypted-Drive-256GB/dp/B07Y465VX1/ref=sxts_rp_s_a_1_0?content-id=amzn1.sym.3432eb1a-1558-4445-9430-9bb3e7f7b9b7%3Aamzn1.sym.3432eb1a-1558-4445-9430-9bb3e7f7b9b7\u0026crid=WP3874YV3ZNH\u0026cv_ct_cx=iodd\u0026keywords=iodd\u0026pd_rd_i=B07Y465VX1\u0026pd_rd_r=3beb27e0-ab5b-4250-bc41-92fc55d53cdf\u0026pd_rd_w=2lydt\u0026pd_rd_wg=aCQHI\u0026pf_rd_p=3432eb1a-1558-4445-9430-9bb3e7f7b9b7\u0026pf_rd_r=P4SD2MQPNHRNRB8F22EK\u0026qid=1687409113\u0026sprefix=io%2Caps%2C330\u0026sr=1-1-5985efba-8948-4f09-9122-d605505c9d1e\u0026ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.d977788f-1483-4f76-90a3-786e4cdc8f10)\n\n## NetAlly LinkSprinter\nNetAlly (also known as NetScout) makes a wide range of diagnostic network gear. I've had the pleasure of using their EtherScope nXG, their flagship product, but I'd like to instead include their LinkSprinter offering in my list of favorite hardware. \n\nThis thing is small--like fit in your pocket small. This battery-operated tool lets you plug it into a data drop or switch port, and gather facts about that connection. It will check for physical link at layer 1, see if it gets DHCP, get information about the switch its connected to, check for internet connection, etc. If there is an internet connection, the report of this information gets emailed to you. Additionally, you can connect your smartphone or other WiFi-enabled device to it's ad-hoc network to view the report via a web browser. \n\nWhile handy for a systems administrator, it is **extremely valuable** to be able to hand one to a technician and have them use it as a diagnostic tool. At around $400 USD at the time of writing, this can be such a timesaver and huge value add, especially on mid-size teams.\n\n[Link](https://www.amazon.com/NETSCOUT-LSPRNTR-300-LinkSprinter-Distance-Indication/dp/B00UD6G2OY/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2J55FNE5LR2QM\u0026keywords=linksprinter\u0026qid=1687409395\u0026s=electronics\u0026sprefix=linksprinte%2Celectronics%2C149\u0026sr=1-1-catcorr\u0026ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.5137e923-c7be-4142-979c-7c68b6c26f63)\n\n## LTT Screwdriver\nWhile a lot of people frowned on the price point of this screwdriver, and the fact that it's made by a \"YouTube company,\" I have to say it's the single best ratcheting screwdriver I've ever used. It has quickly become a preferred and essential piece of my server room toolkit.\n\nIt's bit enough that you can put some force behind it, but small enough that it isn't clunky and unwieldy. Some bit storage, magnetized tips, and a fantastic and ultra-satisfying ratcheting mechanism make this a great piece of kit.\n\n[Link](https://www.lttstore.com/products/screwdriver)\n\n## LTT Backpack\nLike the screwdriver, the backpack had some attention around it and many people voicing their concerns and outrage at the $250 USD price point. For years previously I had the [SwissGear Laptop Backpack for Tool Storage](https://www.amazon.com/SwissGear-Backpack-Storage-15-Inch-Notebook/dp/B07N141974/ref=sr_1_3?crid=2M7RU617IT0OI\u0026keywords=swiss+laptop+tool+backpack\u0026qid=1687409744\u0026sprefix=swiss+laptop+tool+backpac%2Caps%2C156\u0026sr=8-3\u0026ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.d977788f-1483-4f76-90a3-786e4cdc8f10) and mostly liked it, but had some significant gripes such as the fact that it never sat upright correctly, the pockets were a little *too* specific, and it was *not* comfortable to haul around. \n\nI decided to bite the bullet after following the creation process of the LTT Backpack, and bought one. I've now had it for about six months, and I have absolutely zero regrets. The bag is very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time, even when loaded up a bit. The quality of the materials is excellent. It has tons of storage, with a nice balance of purpose-built pockets and large cavities for bulk storage. I would not hesitate to recommend this bag to anyone.\n\n[Link](https://www.lttstore.com/products/backpack)\n\n## StarTech 1P3FPC-USB-SERIAL Adapter\nHave you ever had to fumble around with COM ports and drivers when you just need to console into a network switch? Because I have. And nearly every person I've worked with has. Don't bother!\n\nOne of my bosses recommended this to me after I'd expressed my woes of having to get my console cable to work every time I needed it. Since buying this one, I've never had a single problem. Plug it in and get configuring! It's the only adapter for console cables that I've not had issues with, and is only about $35 USD, so don't sleep on it, go for it.\n\n[Link](https://www.amazon.com/StarTech-com-Retention-Converter-Prolific-1P3FPC-USB-SERIAL/dp/B09T75BYJP/ref=sr_1_9?crid=Q2ERMEYUX48\u0026keywords=startech+usb+serial+cable\u0026qid=1687411104\u0026sprefix=startech+usb+serial+cabl%2Caps%2C163\u0026sr=8-9)\n\n# Conclusion\nThese have been just a few of my favorite tools, especially the ones that make my life as a systems administrator significantly easier.

But what is it? This well-built, open-source, and peer-reviewed app for your phone and computer can send and receive text messages and multimedia messages, group texts, handle phone calls for you, and more!\n\nBut this isn't your grandma's messaging app. There is something specific about it that makes the free app worthy of mention, and recommendation:\n\n**Privacy.**\n\nAh, privacy. It used to be something we all had. However, with the rapid growth of a connected and online world, most people enjoy significantly less privacy than they previously did. Websites track you, apps send data about you to their developers, your purchase history, search history, web browsing history, and so much more is bought and sold by businesses around the world in an effort to better advertise to you -- or accomplish more nefarious objectives. And [working with tech and in IT](/_index.md), I am drawn to this type of stuff. So...Signal?\n\nSignal offers privacy that other messaging applications do not. Any phone calls or messages sent from a Signal user to another Signal user are end-to-end encrypted, making them¬†_very_¬†difficult for unwanted listeners/viewers to access. Beyond that, you can rest assured your data isn't being collected and sold to the highest bidder since the only data Signal retains about its users is:\n\n- Unix timestamps for when each account was created\n- the date that each account last connected to the Signal service\n\nYou can read more about the data they store, and also examples of data they have provided when previously subpoenaed in¬†[this article](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8562458718891840214/4850154605545152848#).\n\n![](https://audiomgtmoregame.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/image.png?w=802)\n\nPhoto from¬†[CNBC](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8562458718891840214/4850154605545152848#)\n\nSignal provides a variety of optional features that we've seen claim popularity on other platforms (that are¬†_definitely_¬†tracking you and selling your data) such as:\n\n- Group messaging\n- Stickers, emojis, GIFs, and other animated graphics\n- Disappearing messages\n- Typing icon/notifications and other chat-like features\n- Customizable conversations and notifications per-conversation\n- Voice and video calls -- including group video calls\n- Registering with your phone number instead of creating a complicated account\n- No cellular service required when sending between Signal users as long as you have WiFi (think like iMessage or Facebook Messenger, both of which may invade your privacy, especially given their companies' history with data and privacy issues)\n\n...and all of it can be encrypted and completely private. If all your contacts aren't on Signal yet, that's okay; it won't get in the way of communicating with them. Signal handles regular unencrypted text, multimedia, and group messages just a quickly and elegantly as Signal messages.\n\nFunded by grants and donations, open-source, peer-reviewed and audited, Signal is a best bet in maintaining your privacy while communicating.\n\nYou can get Signal for your device at these links as of date this article was published:\n\n[Android](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8562458718891840214/4850154605545152848#)¬†|¬†[iOS](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8562458718891840214/4850154605545152848#)¬†|¬†[Windows](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8562458718891840214/4850154605545152848#)¬†|¬†[macOS](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8562458718891840214/4850154605545152848#)¬†|¬†[Debian-based Linux Distributions](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8562458718891840214/4850154605545152848#)\n\nGive it a try!

Services in the Fediverse tend to be decentralized with multiple instances able to connect together via federation to allow users on each instance to interact with content across multiple of the instances.\n\nThere are a variety of services in the Fediverse including open-source and other alternatives to popular sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, YouTube, etc.\n\n![fediverse-branches-axbom-30-CC-BY-SA.png](/published/media/fediverse-branches-axbom-30-CC-BY-SA.png)\n*The above image is from [axbom.com](https://axbom.com/fediverse/). Be sure to check out their site!*\n\nA quick overview of some of the analogous services:\n\n| **Typical Social Platform** | **Example of Fediverse Service** |\n| ----------------------- | ----------------------------- |\n| Facebook                | [Friendica](https://friendi.ca/)                     |\n| Twitter                 | [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/about)                      |\n| Reddit                  | [Lemmy](https://join-lemmy.org/) or [/kbin](https://kbin.pub/en)                 |\n| Instagram               | [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org/)                      |\n| YouTube                 | [PeerTube](https://joinpeertube.org/en_US)                      |\n\n## How does it work?\nInstances of Fediverse services can, but are not required to, interact with each other. This allows instances to set their own rules and policies for people whose accounts live in that instance, but if federated with another instance, those users can still interact with the remote instance's content. A benefit of this is that people can choose to create their accounts in instances which best match their requirements and whatnot, and communities of like-minded people can choose to disengage from other instances if those instances are poorly moderated, maintained, etc. \n\nFor a more in depth look at how federation between instances in the Fediverse works, check out this excellent [post](https://lemmy.world/post/149743) on lemmy.world, one of many popular instances of Lemmy.\n\n## Pros and Cons\n### Pros\n- Decentralized infrastructure\n- Not commercialized, no advertising\n- Passionate, dedicated communities\n- Familiar general functionality\n- Variety of web and application clients\n### Cons\n- Slightly more friction to get started\n- Less mature than some commercial services thus fewer users\n- You friends and your grandma probably haven't heard of it\n\n## How Many People Have Joined the Fediverse?\nYou can find relatively up-to-date statistics for the major services and their many instances on the website for the [FediDB](https://fedidb.org/) project. As of February 2023, there were nearly 10 million users in the Fediverse.\n\n## Getting Started with Federated Social Media\nI recommend looking at what your objective is. For some people, it will be replacing a particular service such as Twitter or Reddit or whatnot. Look at what services are available in the Fediverse, and pick one as your replacement. As an example, you could join Mastodon instead of using Twitter. Visit the service's main website. Find an instance, and create an account. Once\n\n\u003e[!tip] Reddit Refugees  \n\u003e\n\u003eAre you a \"Reddit refugee\" looking for a new link-aggregator following Reddit's terrible handling of their API pricing changes, community support, and treatment of platform moderators?

The Fediverse has had a veritable explosion over the last couple of years between the mass exodus from Twitter a year or two back, and now the mass exodus from Reddit this year. While all your friends and family may not be in the Fediverse just yet, it doesn't mean you can't be the first.
