{"/":{"title":"blog.griff.systems","content":"\n# Achievement Get! \nYou've found my blog. This site is a small side project of mine. I take a lot of notes throughout the course of my work in IT. I've forgotten more than I'll ever learn and I try to remedy that by taking detailed notes and writing them out into reproduceable guides and documentation. The more polished of those notes will be published here in the hopes that they might assist another systems administrator or IT professional headed down the same path or in search of the same answers. \n\nThe occasional non-technical post may find it's way here as well, since I love all things organization, and recently dipped my toes into the Fediverse (or \"federated social universe\"), which is comprised of a lot of tech concepts I find interesting, but aren't directly related to IT.\n\n# About the Site\nThis blog is hosted via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), using the [Hugo SSG](https://gohugo.io/) (static-site generator); this is packaged nicely by Jacky Zhao's [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/). The site content is written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)and managed in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), which is my preferred knowledge management/notetaking application.\n\nBeing able to write in Markdown makes things much simpler for me, and since I already write Markdown in Obsidian and had a GitHub account with a couple of other repositories that I push notes to, it just seemed natural to bring those things together for this blog. I was very lucky to stumble onto the Quartz project which made it pretty simple to get going. \n\n# About the Author\nGriffeth Barker is an IT Systems Administrator, husband, and lover of technology, board/card/dice/video games, analog photography, racquetball, and all things organization.\n\n---\nOther Blogs I Like\n- [All the Systems](http://allthesystems.com/)\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-06-20T05:37:37.542477289Z","tags":[]},"/published/2023/Signal-What-this-app-is-and-why-we-should-use-it":{"title":"Signal - What this app is and why we should use it","content":"You may have heard of Signal, or seen the Signal icon in your phone's respective App Store. But what is it? This well-built, open-source, and peer-reviewed app for your phone and computer can send and receive text messages and multimedia messages, group texts, handle phone calls for you, and more!\n\nBut this isn't your grandma's messaging app. There is something specific about it that makes the free app worthy of mention, and recommendation:\n\n**Privacy.**\n\nAh, privacy. It used to be something we all had. However, with the rapid growth of a connected and online world, most people enjoy significantly less privacy than they previously did. Websites track you, apps send data about you to their developers, your purchase history, search history, web browsing history, and so much more is bought and sold by businesses around the world in an effort to better advertise to you -- or accomplish more nefarious objectives. And [working with tech and in IT](/_index.md), I am drawn to this type of stuff. So...Signal?\n\nSignal offers privacy that other messaging applications do not. Any phone calls or messages sent from a Signal user to another Signal user are end-to-end encrypted, making them _very_ difficult for unwanted listeners/viewers to access. Beyond that, you can rest assured your data isn't being collected and sold to the highest bidder since the only data Signal retains about its users is:\n\n- Unix timestamps for when each account was created\n- the date that each account last connected to the Signal service\n\nYou can read more about the data they store, and also examples of data they have provided when previously subpoenaed in [this article](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8562458718891840214/4850154605545152848#).\n\n![](https://audiomgtmoregame.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/image.png?w=802)\n\nPhoto from [CNBC](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8562458718891840214/4850154605545152848#)\n\nSignal provides a variety of optional features that we've seen claim popularity on other platforms (that are _definitely_ tracking you and selling your data) such as:\n\n- Group messaging\n- Stickers, emojis, GIFs, and other animated graphics\n- Disappearing messages\n- Typing icon/notifications and other chat-like features\n- Customizable conversations and notifications per-conversation\n- Voice and video calls -- including group video calls\n- Registering with your phone number instead of creating a complicated account\n- No cellular service required when sending between Signal users as long as you have WiFi (think like iMessage or Facebook Messenger, both of which may invade your privacy, especially given their companies' history with data and privacy issues)\n\n...and all of it can be encrypted and completely private. If all your contacts aren't on Signal yet, that's okay; it won't get in the way of communicating with them. Signal handles regular unencrypted text, multimedia, and group messages just a quickly and elegantly as Signal messages.\n\nFunded by grants and donations, open-source, peer-reviewed and audited, Signal is a best bet in maintaining your privacy while communicating.\n\nYou can get Signal for your device at these links as of date this article was published:\n\n[Android](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8562458718891840214/4850154605545152848#) | [iOS](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8562458718891840214/4850154605545152848#) | [Windows](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8562458718891840214/4850154605545152848#) | [macOS](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8562458718891840214/4850154605545152848#) | [Debian-based Linux Distributions](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8562458718891840214/4850154605545152848#)\n\nGive it a try!
