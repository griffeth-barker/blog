This site is a small side project of mine. I take a lot of notes throughout the course of my work in IT. I've forgotten more than I'll ever learn and I try to remedy that by taking detailed notes and writing them out into reproduceable guides and documentation. The more polished of those notes will be published here in the hopes that they might assist another systems administrator or IT professional headed down the same path or in search of the same answers. \n\nThe occasional non-technical post may find it's way here as well, since I love all things organization, and recently dipped my toes into the Fediverse (or \"federated social universe\"), which is comprised of a lot of tech concepts I find interesting, but aren't directly related to IT.\n\n# Dive In\nYou can browse the blog by going to the [Table of Contents](/toc).\n\n# About this Site\nThis blog is hosted via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), using the [Hugo SSG](https://gohugo.io/) (static-site generator); this is packaged nicely by Jacky Zhao's [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/).

Or how about when you open a program and it tells you there's an update? You just want to use your software, so if you're like me, you've probably clicked \"ignore\" or closed the update to just get to what you were doing. But there is a better way! Nobody wants to take the time to keep all of their software up-to-date. In this brief blog post, I take a look at how you can make this happen \"auto-magically,\" at least for many common programs.\n\n# Installing Chocolatey package manager\n\n![](https://audiomgtmoregame.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/chocolatey-logo.png?w=1024)\n\nThe first thing we will need to do is install the Chocolatey package manager. This is going to let us have access to one central source for the programs and their updates.\n\nTo install Chocolatey, open Windows PowerShell by going to the Start Menu and typing `powershell` . Right-click the top result, and click \"Run as Administrator.\" This will require you to have administrative rights. If you do not have administrative rights, this process will not be possible.\n\nIn the Windows PowerShell window that appears, paste the following command:\n```PowerShell\nSet-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))\n```\n\nOnce that command has completed, close Windows PowerShell and launch it again with administrative rights like we just did.\n\n# Installing packages\n\nNow we need to install the packages that we want to keep up-to-date. To find out if a program you have has a package available, use the below example in PowerShell:\n\nchoco search _programname_\n\nwhere _programname_ is the name of the program you want. Some examples might be:\n\n- adobereader\n- adobe-connect\n- googlechrome\n- microsoft-edge\n- discord\n- putty\n- icue\n- bitwarden\n- lastpass\n- obs-studio\n- conemu\n- forticlientvpn\n- openvpn\n- java\n- jre\n- logitech-options\n- reflect-free\n- and many, many more.\n\nTo actually install any or a combination of these, use the following command:\n```PowerShell\nchoco install programname -y\n```\n\nwhere `programname` is the package name. You can list multiple package names in succession to install multiple programs at once:\n\n```PowerShell\nchoco install programname1 programname2 programname3 -y\n```\n\nChocolatey will download the packages and install them.\n\n# Writing the update script\n\nWith the packages installed, now we need to create a super simple script that will update those packages.\n\nOpen Notepad by going to the Start Menu and typing \"notepad\" (quotations omitted) and running the top result.\n\nIn the blank document that opens, type the following:\n```PowerShell\nchoco upgrade all -Y\n```\n\nIf you continually run into errors with certain packages updating and don't mind the insecurity of it, you can also use:\n\nchoco upgrade all -Y --ignore-checksums\n\n\u003e[!warning] Warning\n\u003eThis is not necessarily a security best practice. You should proceed with caution and as appropriate to your environment.\n\nNow save this by going to File \u003e Save As... In the Save As window, change the drop-down menu for the file type. It will be defaulted to .txt and we want to change it to All Files. Type a name for the file ending with .ps1. Example:\n\nchocolatey-updater.ps1\n\nSave it to a location where it won't be touched and will always be available. I have mine saved to a folder I created at C:\\ScheduledTasks but you can put yours wherever you want.\n\n## Scheduling automatic updates\n\nFinally, now that we have installed packages and created a script to update them, we will want to schedule the update process to be completely automatic. Because being hands-off is the whole point!\n\nOpen the Task Scheduler by clicking the Start Menu and typing \"task scheduler\" then running the top result.\n\nIn the resulting Task Scheduler window, open the Action menu, then click Create Task.\n\n![](https://audiomgtmoregame.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/screenshot-2020-12-15-135956.jpg?w=532)\n\nGive your scheduled task a name and a description, then select \"Run whether user is logged in or not\" and check \"Run with highest privileges.\" Finally, Configure for: Windows 10.\n\nMove to the Triggers tab.\n\n![](https://audiomgtmoregame.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-3.png?w=976)\n\nAdd a new trigger to begin the task on a schedule. Input your desired start date, reoccurence period, and ensure \"Enabled\" is checked, then click OK.\n\nMove to the Actions tab.\n\n![](https://audiomgtmoregame.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-4.png?w=972)\n\nMake the action \"Start a program\" and in the Program/script field, paste the path to PowerShell:\n\n%SystemRoot%\\system32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe\n\nIn the Add arguments field, add the following:\n\n-file scriptpath\n\nwhere scriptpath is the path to where you saved your script earlier. My example looked like this:\n\n-file C:\\ScheduledTasks\\chocolatey-updates.ps1\n\nWhen done, click OK on all remaining Task Scheduler windows and the task will be scheduled. Now, as long as your computer is on, you leave the task scheduled, and the script is available where you saved it, your computer should automatically update your specified programs without you having to do anything at all.\n\nI have been keeping my computers up to date like this for several years (set to automatically update everything weekly) and it saves me tons of time, and I rarely get notifications about new versions or annoying popups anymore.\n\n## Bringing it all together\n\nIn this process, we installed Chocolately package manager, figured out what programs we wanted to keep up to date that were available through Chocolatey, installed those programs, wrote the update script/command, and scheduled PowerShell to run that command at a regular interval.\n\nHow did this go for you? Got any other neat tips and tricks for keeping your system running in great shape? I'd love for you to share them in the comments.","lastmodified":"2023-06-22T02:28:54.182645134Z","tags":["windows","software","patching","chocolatey"]},"/published/2020/powershell_remove_net_printer_for_all_users":{"title":"Use PowerShell to remove a network printer for all users","content":"\n# Purpose\nThis brief article details the commands necessary to use PowerShell to remove a network printer for all users of a computer.\n\n# Prerequisites\nThe below actions require the executing user to be an administrator of the remote workstation, or a Domain Administrator.\n\n# Solution\n## Establish a Remote PowerShell session\nIn an elevated PowerShell session (running as administrator), run the following command;\n```PowerShell\nEnter-PsSession -ComputerName HOSTNAME.FQDN\n```\nwhere `HOSTNAME.FQDN` is the fully-qualified domain name of the workstation in question.\n\n_Example:_ `desktop01.yourdomain.com`  \n\nYou _can_ actually perform these commands without using the FQDN, and using the short name instead.\n\n## Remove the network printer for all users\nOnce you’ve entered the remote PowerShell session successfully, run the following commands in sequence;\n```PowerShell\nGet-WmiObject -Class Win32_Printer | Where-Object {$_.Name -eq ‘\\\\PRINTSERVER\\Shared-printer‘}\n```\nwhere `PRINTSERVER` is the NETBIOS name of your print server from which the printer is shared and `Shared-printer` is the shared name of the printer you’d like to remove.

I'm sorry to say, but I am going to spend a moment griping about it again. Over the last several months, I have been constantly frustrated with the pen not attaching without careful placement, the pen falling off the magnet, and my inevitable loss of the pen since it fell off the magnet somewhere. Sure, you can get a case that secures the pen--but this should not be necessary. By design, the pen should be easy to keep track of, use, and stow. This has become a major downside to the device, for me at least. But onto more positive things.*\n\u003e\n_One of my primary questions was whether I could use the tablet as a replacement for my laptop when traveling. The short answer is: **absolutely**! I spent the week of my recent vacation reading books, browsing the web, writing for this blog, editing a couple of casual photos, playing games, doing email, and a couple of other tasks, including troubleshooting some stuff with my parents' home network. I had brought my laptop--just in case--and found that I didn't pull it out even once. The Tab S6 was all I needed! Now, a qualification is necessary here. I did bring my Logitech MX Master 3 bluetooth mouse and my Keychron K6 bluetooth mechanical keyboard for when I was writing my blog posts, but otherwise, the tablet by itself was just fine._\n\u003e\n_So, my verdict after such extended use and travel with the Tab S6, is that I highly recommend it, but do note that some kind of case or other solution to keep track of the pen will be absolutely necessary._\n\nReleased in August of 2019, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 becomes the new Samsung standard for tablets, in place of the Tab 4 and Tab 5Se. I  picked up the Tab S6 on an open-box deal from Best Buy (not sponsored). I have previously owned an iPad Mini years back, as well as the Microsoft Surface Pro 3, though I no longer have either. The itch for a tablet was strong, and this time around, Samsung won the vote. But why? Let's take a look at some of the selling points.\n\n# Price\n\nThe Tab S6, without the open-box deal I got, currently retails for roughly $650.00 USD for the base model at the time of writing. However, if you keep an eye out, you can snag an open-box deal on one for about 200.00 USD less! And at that price point, this tablet really packs a punch. Why?\n\n# Specifications\n\nBecause 650.00 USD (or 450.00 USD in my case) gets you a 10.5 inch screen, 128 GB of solid state storage, 6 GB of RAM, and a snappy octa-core processor. The base price even includes the tablet's pen like with the Microsoft Surface, which other tablet manufacturers either don't have (looking at you, Kindle) or require you to purchase separately (Apple).\n\n# UX\n\nObviously the user experience is a big deal, since I'm going to be the _user experiencing_ the tablet. I was looking for a true tablet experience for while I am away from my custom desktop computer. I'm big on customization and versatility. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ running Android and enjoy it very much. The Google Play store has a huge variety of apps available, including the Microsoft Office suite, Wordpress, as well as apps for social media, photography, games and other entertainment, as well as utilities that can be useful for an on-the-go IT professional such as myself. Additionally, while I like the Samsung flavor of the graphical user interface, Android allows me to overlay my own preferred launchers should I so desire--and without having to root or jailbreak my device to do so. I am currently using the Microsoft Launcher.\n\nSo thus far I've mentioned a few things that I really like about the device. But what cons are worth mentioning?\n\n# Downfalls\n\nLet's start with the pen. It is made of a plastic, which feels a bit light and cheap--though I suppose I didn't expect too much for an included accessory. It pales in comparison to the pen that comes with the Microsoft Surface, and is also not as good as the Apple Pencil.\n\nDespite being too light for my taste, and a bit cheap-feeling, my biggest gripe comes to storage of the pen. There is a shallow groove on the rear of the device beneath the camera lens. This groove has two magnetic points that hold the pen in place--uh, sometimes. The pen falls off the groove or gets knocked out of place easily, and the groove is difficult to find without looking at the rear of the device. I've lost my pen quite a few times in the last two weeks. To further my compaint, snapping the pen to the rear of the device means that the device can no longer rest flat on a surface such as a table, desk, and also restricts the use of some wall mounts. It also happens to be right where I prefer to hold the device while on the go, which is a bit inconvenient. None of these things will necessarily be a downfall for you, but they were for me. After extensive use, I've found that it is actually quite difficult to attached the pen to it's groove without looking directly at it, and that the pen falls off quite easily, which has become annoying.\n\nFurther, the pen has less functionality than I would like. The S Gestures that you can do to interact with the OS are convenient and nice. Unfortunately, that is where the interaction runs out. The pen can be used as a replacement for your finger in other apps, but the button will continue to function in relation to the OS, not the app, thus prohibiting a large amount of usefulness. One thing I want to be able to do is hold the pen, lean back, and flick it up and down to scroll up and down a webpage or other app, but alas, this functionality seems to be missing.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nReally, the pen was the only complaint I had with the purchase--and though I have things I wish Samsung had done better, the pen is still functional and is not uncomfortable to hold for short amounts of time. The pen might be a dealbreaker for you, or you might never touch it? So what am I doing with the device?\n\nIn the weeks that I've had the Galaxy Tab 6S, I have used it to import photos from my Canon DSLR (no additional software required), edit RAW image files in Google's Snapseed photo editing application--which is shockingly good for being free, browse Reddit, the internet, access banking information, VPN into my home network, VPN into my work network, remote access and administer both workstations and servers, and listened to plenty of music and watched videos on YouTube.\n\nI have had zero issues accomplishing what I need to. In fact, just earlier this evening my wife and I were at dinner and I had the tablet with me. I got a call from work with an emergency. I wouldn't have lugged a laptop with me, but I happened to habe the tablet. Within a minute or so, I was VPN'ed into our company's network, accessed a server, and did what I needed to do to assist an employee.\n\nSimilarly, the other night I had the opportunity to pick up my camera and create some images of my wife. I didn't want to wait to import the photos on my desktop and process them there, so I plugged my camera into my tablet, imported the photos, and processed them, in Snapseed. Within 10 minutes I had a couple of fantastic images to share.\n\nI've found that overall the tablet has conformed to my needs and flexed to every situation I've found myself in thus far. It has been a good buy. Would I buy it again? Most likely! Given that I like to use the pen and the pen is quite subpar, I likely would not pay full price for one, but I would willingly pay open-box or used pricing again. If you're looking for a powerful daily driver of a tablet, then this might just be the ticket for you!","lastmodified":"2023-06-22T02:28:54.186645167Z","tags":["hardware","review"]},"/published/2021/fix_mapped_drives_not_showing_in_dialogues":{"title":"Fix mapped drives not showing in Open and Save dialogues in Windows","content":"\n# Problem\nUser’s mapped drives do not show up as mapped in application Open/Save prompts, even though they show correctly in **File Explorer \u003e This PC**.\n\n# Environment\nThis issue affects Windows 10 workstations joined to a domain where the user has one or more drives that are automatically mapped via Group Policy Object or NETLOGON script.\n\n# Cause\nThis problem occurs because UAC treats members of the Administrators group as standard users.

Everything else will be handled during the install process.\n\n# Installing the Controller\n\nTo get the controller installed on Linux you have many options. Ubiquiti has some instructions on how to install the controller on their website but it only covers the install for a couple of specific versions of Linux. To use Debian, use the script that has been posted on the [Unifi forums](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8562458718891840214/6386954631595199676#) by member AmazedMender16.\n\nTo start the install, first ssh into the Debian server or access the server from the console. Log in either as root or as another user that has root access and then run su.\n\nMake sure your repos are up to date, then install the `ca-certificates` and `wget` packages.\n```bash\napt-get update \u0026\u0026 apt-get install ca-certificates wget -y\n```\n\nDownload and run the Unifi Controller installer script. This script will handle the install of the dependencies and controller software for many different distros of Linux including the Debian 10 server we are using.\n```bash\nwget https://get.glennr.nl/unifi/install/install_latest/unifi-latest.sh1 bash unifi-latest.sh\n```\n\nYou will be prompted for a few things while the script runs. First, it will ask if you want to keep the script downloaded after the install. In most cases this is not required, so you should enter `n` and then press enter.\n\n# Ensuring the Unifi controller software is up to date\n\nYou may receive a prompt to update packages during the install. Enter `y` and then press enter.\n\n# Confirming it’s OK to update packages\n\nFinally, you will be prompted to add the apt repo for Unifi to update the controller from apt. Enter `y` and press enter as this will make upgrades serviceable through apt.\n\nOnce the install completes, the script will output the version of the controller installed and the URL to use to start configuring the controller.\n\n# Configuring the Controller\n\nOnce you have the controller software installed on whatever server you are using the setting will be the same.\n\nGo to the web address `https://\u003cServerIP\u003e:8443/` and you will be presented with the controller's web portal.","lastmodified":"2023-06-22T02:28:54.186645167Z","tags":["linux","unifi","ubiquiti"]},"/published/2021/password_managers_and_why_you_should_be_using_one":{"title":"Password managers and why you should be using one","content":"\n Let me ask you some questions:\n\n- Do you have that one account that you only have to log into once in a blue moon, and you pretty much always have to reset the password?\n- Do any of your accounts use the same password?\n- Do you have any of your passwords written down somewhere or typed out in a Word document or Excel spreadsheet or some other similar list?\n\nIf you answered \"yes\" to one or more of these questions, then using a password manager may benefit you.\n\n# What is a password manager?\n\nA password manager is an program that digitally and securely stores your login information for various accounts. Using just a single \"master password,\" you can access the login information for any and all of your stored accounts witout having to know every account's information.\n\n# Why use a password manager?\n\n## Security\n\nThe most important benefit of a password manager is security. If you have your passwords written down somewhere, then it is more likely someone may accidentally (or intentionally) find out how to access your accounts; additionally, if they're written down, they can be lost or destroyed. If you have more than one account using the same password, if that password is discovered or stolen, the theif could gain access to many of your accounts. Using a password manager allows you to securely store your passwords, have convenient access to them, and also lets you generate more complex and secure passwords without the need to memorize them.\n\n## Simplicity\n\nSecurity is important. But the extra-nice thing about a password maanger is the simplicity. Instead of having to remember of the logon information for many accounts, you can simply remember a single \"master password.\" Some password managers even support web browser add-ons/extensions that will auto-fill your login information into a webpage after you enter your master password.\n\n# My recommended solution\n\n![](https://audiomgtmoregame.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/bitwarden_logo_horizontal.png?w=1024)\n\n**Bitwarden** is a fantastic and free option for a password manager. I have been using Bitwarden for several years and love it. The solution is open-source, free, and supported on the many platforms and browsers listed below.\n\nOperating systems: [Windows](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8562458718891840214/2826015379359740939#) | [macOS](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8562458718891840214/2826015379359740939#) | [Linux](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8562458718891840214/2826015379359740939#) | [Android](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8562458718891840214/2826015379359740939#) | [iOS](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8562458718891840214/2826015379359740939#)\n\nBrowsers: [Edge](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8562458718891840214/2826015379359740939#) | [Chrome](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8562458718891840214/2826015379359740939#) | [Opera](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8562458718891840214/2826015379359740939#) | [Firefox](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8562458718891840214/2826015379359740939#) | [Tor](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8562458718891840214/2826015379359740939#) | [Vivaldi](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8562458718891840214/2826015379359740939#) | [Brave](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8562458718891840214/2826015379359740939#) | [Safari](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8562458718891840214/2826015379359740939#)\n\nAdditionally, Bitwarden features web-based access via the [web portal](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8562458718891840214/2826015379359740939#) and also has powerful command-line tools (CLI) to create and execute scripts against your Bitwarden Vault.\n\n![](https://audiomgtmoregame.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/web-vault-macbook.png?w=1024)\n\nWeb portal access to your Bitwarden Vault\n\nWith Bitwarden, securing your online accounts is as simple as creating a free account, setting your master password, and entering the information you'd like to store. If you're like me and had all your login info in an Excel spreadsheet, then you're in luck, because Bitwarden supports the import of .CSV files to making your setup process breeze by quickly.\n\nOther neat stuff Bitwarden supports includes: locally hosting it on your own server instead of cloud hosted, it supports multi-factor authentication and is compatible with the Yubico YubiKey (a review on that to come), a password generator, configuration for auto-fill on websites, and the ability to store more than passwords securely--including secure notes, credit card information, and identity information. And so much more.\n\nAvailable on every major platform and cloud-accessible, Bitwarden is a fast, convenient, and free solution to enhance your online security and make your life easier.\n\n# Other Options\n\nBitwarden is fantastic, but it won't be for everyone.

If you haven't tried a password manager, don't delay! Try one today.\n\nHave you used a password manager before? If so, what was it and what were your thoughts? Have you had other issues or complaints about memorizing passwords? I'd love to hear your thoughts in the comments.","lastmodified":"2023-06-22T02:28:54.186645167Z","tags":["software","security"]},"/published/2021/revert_node_certificates_to_default_in_proxmox_ve":{"title":"Revert node certificates to default in Proxmox VE","content":"\n# Purpose\nThe purpose of this document is to explain the steps necessary to reset and regenerate the state of the node/host certificates.\n\n# Assumptions\nThis document assumes you have a properly functioning Proxmox cluster with all nodes accessible on the network/via web browser.

There's so much information that we deal with on a daily basis. Not only is there an interminable amount of information, but then there's the stuff you have to _do_ with that information — which usually ends up generating more information, or more stuff for you to do with the new information. That explanation might sound as muddled as the actual process of managing everything going on in life.\n\nEnter: note taking and organization applications. There are a variety of apps and tools that help with managing information like notes, schedules, files, etc. These solutions range from the simplest of apps — such as the Notes app included in iOS or the To-do app in Windows 10 — to more robust solutions such as Microsoft's OneNote, as well as more speciality and niche solutions such as Milanote. There are tons of options, though they range in functionality and compatibility with various platforms.\n\nFor example, many people love Bear and it's Markdown-based formatting, but it is only available on iOS and macOS. Others prefer OneNote for it's wide compatibility across many platforms (even Linux distributions, if you're willing to put in a bit of work), but then struggle with many of the glitches and downfalls of Microsoft's less-than-consistent user experience and functionality.\n\nWith just as many options as the information you have to manage, there has to be one that sticks out among the others. I have a notion that there are a few. One of them is...well...Notion!\n\n# What is Notion?\n\nNotion advertises itself as the \"all-in-one\" workspace for your whole team. It provides writing, planning, and organizational utility in a way that can easily be harnessed by either individuals or entire teams and companies. The features are so robust that many organizations ranging from enterprises such as Pixar, IBM, Nike, and Slack to prominent creators and platform providers in various industries such as Spotify, Square, and even content creators such as Linus Media Group. But it's also used by many students, teachers, writers, podcasters, and many other individuals.\n\n# What can Notion do?\n\nNotion is one of those solutions where you get a lot of flexibility to make it do most whatever you'd like it to. But out of the box, there is a wide range of things that it can do to help you keep track of all your notions.\n\n- Organize just about any information you can think of\n- Central, powerful search of all your stuff\n- Realtime collaboration with other users\n- Scalable - start as small as you and grow your workspace with your needs\n- Embedded apps such as Google Docs, Figma, Twitter, Github, CodePen, Spotify, and more\n- Project and task management\n- Multi-database view\n- Focus-based notetaking\n- Drag and drop organization — or metadata organization\n- Rich and varied content support\n- Content creation and tracking\n- New API functionality to tie in other applications and automate functions\n- And so much more...\n\n# Why should I use Notion?\n\nThe reason to use Notion can vary from person to person, however most people use it because it is an effective and easy solution to organize all kinds of information, and it's free. One of my favorite reasons to use it is that it is one of the few solutions that I have used where it really feels like it was designed by actual people, for actual people to use.\n\nBy and large, it is simple to pick up and start using right away without diving too deep in guides and having to learn. If you want to dive into more advanced stuff, you absolutely can and there is a great website, many community members' blogs, and a Discord server full of helpful people that make advanced tinkering and organization easy.\n\nWhatever your reason is, there's nothing to lose by giving Notion a shot and making a go at organizing anything and everything you could want.

Print servers are prime candidates to be hosted on the CLI-based Windows Server Core variant of Windows Server, especially where they are so easily managed through remote PowerShell. In this brief article, we'll take a quick look at spinning up a core print server and some of the options available for administering the new server.\n\n# Spinning up your machine\n\nWhether you are using traditional hardware for your server (a rackmount server, blade server, tower server/desktop PC) or a virtualized environment, you'll first need to actually install Windows Server Core on your machine. For my environment, I spun up a virtual machine in my Proxmox virtual environment, but many may be using VMware, Hyper-V, or other solutions which will work perfectly fine.\n\n# Adding the features and roles to the server\n\nOnce you have Windows installed and your requisite network and domain configuration done, add the necessary services and features to the server:\n\n```PowerShell\nInstall-WindowsFeature Print-Services\n```\n\nThis will install the Print Services role as well as the Print Server Role Service. No further configuration is necessary as far as the services and features go. All that is left to do is add some printers!\n\n# Administering the server\n\nThere are multiple ways to administer your new Windows Core print server.\n\n### PowerShell\n\nArguably the correct way to manage a Windows Core server, is PowerShell. Like other deployments, a print server is managable through the command line with general ease. Beginning with Server 2012's Core version, there are many print management commands available to administrators.\n\nAs an example, we can configure a printer using just two commands:\n\nAdding the printer port:\n\n```PowerShell\nAdd-PrinterPort -Name \"192.168.254.5\" -PrinterHostAddress \"192.168.254.5\"\n```\n\nAdding, sharing, and publishing the printer:\n```PowerShell\nAdd-Printer -Name YourPrinter01 -DriverName \"HP Universal Print Driver PCL6\" -PortName 192.168.254.5 -Shared -ShareName \"YourPrinter01\" -Published\n```\n\n### VBS\n\nAn archaic option also exists. At `C:\\Windows\\System32\\Printing_Admin_Scripts` you'll find a variety of VBS scripts that can be used to administer the print server. But seriously, who is preferring VBS when we have PowerShell?\n\nAs an example, we can configure a printer using the following commands:\n\n\n```PowerShell\n# Creating the printer port:\ncscript prnport.vbs -a -r 192.168.254.5 -h 192.168.254.5 -o raw\n\n# Adding printer on a specific printer port:\ncscript prnmngr.vbs -a -p YourPrinter01 -m \"HP Universal Print Driver PCL6\" -r 192.168.254.5\n\n# Sharing the printer:\ncscript prncnfg.vbs -t -p YourPrinter01 -r 192.168.254.5 -h YourPrinter01 +shared -direct -m \"Default printer for HR\" -l \"YourDesiredLocation\"\n\n# Publishing the printer to Active Directory:\ncscript pubprn.vbs \\\\printserver\\YourPrinter01 \"LDAP://CN=YourContainer,DC=YourDomain,DC=com\"\n```\n\n\n### GUI\n\nIf you really just can't let go of using the graphical user interface just yet as you ease into command-line-based administration you can still get your hands on the GUI by executing: `C:\\Windows\\System32\\printui.exe /il`\n\nAdditionally, on a remote machine, you can connect RSAT to your Windows Core print server and use the Print Management snap-in for the Microsoft Management Console to visually administer the print server.\n\nBut seriously...get comfortable with PowerShell. This is the way.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nAnd, well, that's pretty much it. There is certainly a more granular level of detail we could go into, but for the purposes of a general overview, I think that does it. Windows Core servers are quick and easy to spin up and an absolute breeze to configure if you are comfortable with PowerShell. In a lab environment, they can also be a great way to get more comfortable with PowerShell if you are just learning. Go ahead and spin up a Windows Core server in VirtualBox or your choice of virtualization bench and give it a try!\n\nWhat are you using core servers for in your environment, and how do you like it?

It used to be something we all had. However, with the rapid growth of a connected and online world, most people enjoy significantly less privacy than they previously did. Websites track you, apps send data about you to their developers, your purchase history, search history, web browsing history, and so much more is bought and sold by businesses around the world in an effort to better advertise to you -- or accomplish more nefarious objectives. And [working with tech and in IT](/_index.md), I am drawn to this type of stuff. So...Signal?\n\nSignal offers privacy that other messaging applications do not. Any phone calls or messages sent from a Signal user to another Signal user are end-to-end encrypted, making them _very_ difficult for unwanted listeners/viewers to access. Beyond that, you can rest assured your data isn't being collected and sold to the highest bidder since the only data Signal retains about its users is:\n\n- Unix timestamps for when each account was created\n- the date that each account last connected to the Signal service\n\nYou can read more about the data they store, and also examples of data they have provided when previously subpoenaed in [this article](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8562458718891840214/4850154605545152848#).\n\n![](https://audiomgtmoregame.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/image.png?w=802)\n\nPhoto from [CNBC](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8562458718891840214/4850154605545152848#)\n\nSignal provides a variety of optional features that we've seen claim popularity on other platforms (that are _definitely_ tracking you and selling your data) such as:\n\n- Group messaging\n- Stickers, emojis, GIFs, and other animated graphics\n- Disappearing messages\n- Typing icon/notifications and other chat-like features\n- Customizable conversations and notifications per-conversation\n- Voice and video calls -- including group video calls\n- Registering with your phone number instead of creating a complicated account\n- No cellular service required when sending between Signal users as long as you have WiFi (think like iMessage or Facebook Messenger, both of which may invade your privacy, especially given their companies' history with data and privacy issues)\n\n...and all of it can be encrypted and completely private. If all your contacts aren't on Signal yet, that's okay; it won't get in the way of communicating with them.
